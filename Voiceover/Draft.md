# Task 0 - Reaching Gehenna Station

Hello and welcome to our programm, employee. I hope your journey went smoothly. 
I don't know how much they told you down at Earth, but we're basically just here to clean up their mess. 
Icarus abandoned this research facility after the projectst failed to meet expectations. 
Still, a lot of the equipment can be used for other experiments at other facilities. After all, it's expensive to shoot things to the moon.

As a train operator you will drive this train through the deserted site and perform various tasks for us. 
If you have any questions you will find a manual somewhere that explains everything you need to know. 

Now, make yourself familiar with everything and just drive forward to reach Gehenna Station. We will contact you again when you reached it.
Good luck.

Mission Control out.

# Task 1 - Reaching Cargo Station

Welcome at Gehenna Station, employee. This is the gateway for all railbased vehicles into the facility grounds. Also the only way out. As stated in security
protocol we're closing the gates behind you. From now on refer to the map on your desk for navigation. Your first real task is to check on Gehenna Station.
We need to know whether the power supply is still active or whether there has been a outage. You will receive the task log via your printer shortly. 
Follow the instructions on it carefully and we will be in touch again once you have completed the task.
