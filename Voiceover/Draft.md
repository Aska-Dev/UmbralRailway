# Task 0 - Reaching Gehenna Station

Hello and welcome to our programm, employee. I hope your journey went smoothly. 
I don't know how much they told you down at Earth, but we're basically just here to clean up. 
Icarus abandoned this research project after it failed to meet expectations. 
Still, a lot of the equipment can be used for other experiments at other facilities. After all, it's expensive to shoot things to the moon.

As a train operator you will drive this train through the deserted site and perform various tasks for us. 
If you have any questions you will find a manual somewhere that explains everything you need to know. 

Now, make yourself familiar with everything and make your way to Gehenna Station. We will contact you again when you reached it.
Good luck.

Mission Control out.
