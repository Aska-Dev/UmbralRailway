### Story Progression

1. Spawning and being greeted from Mission Control (Train is locked during most calls and talks)
2. Having the first mission to go to Gehenna Station => Learning about the manuals and how to control the train
3. Arriving at Gehenna Station, learning about being locked inside the facilities ground
4. New mission to check the power sumply of Gehenna Station => Learning about the computer, connecting to stations and checking the stations status
5. All 3 Power-Generators will be active; the player can choose here wether to tell the truth or wether to lie => result doesn't matter
6. After that he has to reach Cargo Station, where he has to couple a wagon to his train and should bring it to Vesta Station. Mission Control tells them it is rations for some On-Site-Workers at Vesta Station.
7. Player reaches Cargo Station and first time to use station services. After having the wagon he needs to get to Vesta station over a railway turntable and learn how to use that.
8. Arrived at Vesta Station he needs to use station services again to de-couple the wagon and store it at the station. 
9. Suddenly the player can hear gun shots from outside for a few seconds. After that Mission Control would contact the player, noticeably overwhelmed but trying to play it down and tell them to return to Gehenna Station for now and that there was just a malfunction from one of the guards weapons. (The player can now ask themselves why there would need to be guards?) 
10. After returning to the turntable the player will be contacted by a robotic voice via the radio that will ask them to connect to the closest network. No station is around the turntable and usually no network should be available but now there will be. The player will connect to a suspicious network and immediately the download of a file is started. The download ui should give some clues about some overwriting security protocols and disabling some security features etc. After the download is finished Mission Control will reach the player and ask him that they recieved some weird signal from them and that they should confirm if everything was alright. (A signal for "yes" and a signal for "no"). When the player interacts with the signal panel the display will not show the current signal but blink with the words "they lie to you. Don't trust them" for a few seconds before changing back to the displaying the current signal and leaving the player the choice of what to respond. This choice is an import one now and will be remembered. When the player lies and tells Mission Control that all is good they will continue sending them to Gehenna Station to wait for further tasks. If they answer the truth and tell them that something is wrong, they will send them to another stat
